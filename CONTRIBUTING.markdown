The `vim-banned` project, although slow to update, is not abandoned. The rate at which it needs to change is gated by Microsoft's SDL update rhythm. Microsoft used to update the SDL on a yearly basis, but they have been slow to make changes in recent years. The most recent public version of the [`banned.h`](https://github.com/x509cert/banned/blob/master/banned.h) header file indicates that it satisfies SDL 6.0 requirements, so that is where the plugin currently stands. I will make updates as the authoritative header file is itself updated.

However, don't let that stop you from contributing. Maybe you don't approve of my vim script skills. That's fine, make a pull request. Note that I won't accept your PR if your [commit message sucks](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/). If I ask you to change something, please do so and `git commit --amend`. Thank you.
