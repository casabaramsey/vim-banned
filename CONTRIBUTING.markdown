This isn't a very active project. It's not abandoned, but the rate at which it needs to change is gated by Microsoft's SDL update rhythm. Although they update the SDL yearly, they don't always change the list of banned APIs. That said, you should expect at least one update per year where I indicate that the plugin is compatible with the current version of the SDL.

However, don't let that stop you from contributing. Maybe you don't approve of my vim script skills. That's fine: make a pull request. However, if your [commit message sucks](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/) I won't accept it. If I ask you to change something, please `git commit --amend` and `git push -f`. Thank you.
